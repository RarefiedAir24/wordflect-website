## Backend/API Reference: Full Wordflect App Structure & API

This website connects to the main Wordflect backend for user authentication, stats, and gameplay data.

- **For the complete backend/API documentation, data models, and app structure, see:**
  [../wordflect/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md](../wordflect/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md)

### How to Use the Main App Markdown
- The main app's markdown is the single source of truth for backend endpoints, data models, and app structure.
- To find information, open the markdown and search for keywords (e.g., `frames`, `battle`, `auth`, `leaderboard`, `missions`).
- Use the API Endpoint Reference section for request/response examples and integration details.
- As the website grows, refer to the main app's markdown for adding new features or troubleshooting backend connectivity.

*This markdown is the source of truth for the website's structure, goals, and path forward. For backend and API details, always refer to the main Wordflect project's documentation linked above.*


## ðŸŽ® Game Mechanics Reference

### Timer Reward System (v1.0.86+)

For website content, features, or game explanations, here are the current timer reward mechanics:

| Word Length | Time Reward |
|-------------|-------------|
| 3 letters   | +1 second   |
| 4 letters   | +2 seconds  |
| 5 letters   | +3 seconds  |
| 6 letters   | +4 seconds  |
| 7 letters   | +5 seconds  |
| 8 letters   | +6 seconds  |
| 9+ letters  | +0 seconds  |

**Level Up Timer**: When a player reaches a new level, the timer continues from its current value (no reset).

**Notes for Website Content**:
- No level-based time bonuses
- No other time rewards outside of word length
- Timer is capped at 120 seconds maximum
- Level progression does not reset the timer

**Implementation**: See `../wordflect/src/screens/Gamescreen.tsx` in the `handleWordSubmit()` function.
